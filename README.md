# Protein Modification Stability Study using Molecular Dynamics

## Project Overview

This project was developed by VAir under the sponsorship and guidance of Sup'Bi>

This project focuses on studying the stability of protein modification, particularly by incorporating a click reaction at the C-terminus of a protein. This allows a linker to be attached, facilitating the attachment of a single domain antibody (nanobody) to a gold surface. Given the stability of single domain nanobodies, our objective was to understand how modifications affect the protein's conformational stability and binding sites.

## Goals

- **Study Conformational Changes**: Evaluate how protein modifications induce conformational changes.
- **Binding Site Analysis**: Assess the impact of modifications on the protein's binding sites.
- **Simulation Comparisons**: Test and validate our simulations against existing literature to ensure reproducibility.
- **Optimization of Linkers**: Experiment with different linkers to determine the most optimal one for attaching nanobodies to the gold surface.
- **Cost-Effective Pipeline**: Provide additional data to support wet lab findings, offering an overview of steric effects and immobilization position orientation.

## Methodology

### Tools and Software

- **NAMD**: Used for molecular dynamics simulations.
- **Quantum Force Fields**: Employed to model the protein accurately and compare conformational changes.
- **ChemDraw3D and Spaetran 24'**: used to design the linker for the click chemistry

### Steps

1. **Modification and Modeling**: Modify the protein to include a click reaction at its C-terminus.
2. **Simulation**: Perform molecular dynamics simulations using NAMD.
3. **Analysis**: Compare the conformational changes and binding site alterations pre- and post-modification.
4. **Validation**: Cross-check our simulations with other studies in literature to ensure reproducibility.
5. **Optimization**: Test various linkers to identify the most effective one for attaching the single domain nanobody to the gold surface.
6. **Preparation for Wet Lab**: Utilize simulation data to guide and support wet lab experiments.

## Results

- **Conformational Changes**: The modification induced significant conformational changes.
- **Binding Sites**: The modifications affected the binding sites of the protein.

## Future Work

- **Simulation Validation**: Continue testing other simulations from literature to further validate our pipeline.
- **Linker Optimization**: Experiment with additional linkers to select the most optimal for attachment.
- **Wet Lab Testing**: Begin wet lab experiments based on our simulation findings to validate our computational results.
